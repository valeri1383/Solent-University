'''
We wish to help Beep and Bop search the books.
You should start by creating a suitable text file named books.txt and store it in the following location:

data/files/txt/books.txt
The text file should contain the following:

Section:The Law Section
The Magna Carta
Section:The Technology Section
How to build a robot
How to build a flying car
Section:The History Section
The history of everything

The program should consist of the following two functions:

The first function should be named search and should take 1 parameter that represents the name of a file.
The function should start by displaying the message "Searching...".
The function should then create an empty dictionary named data.
The function should then open the specified file for reading.
For each line in the file, the function should do the following:
    If the line begins with "Section" then
         Retrieve the section name (e.g. "The Law Section" should be retrieved if the line is "Section:The Law Section". Note that you should use the methods str.startswith() and str.split() to help you with this.)
         Store the section name in a variable named section that will be used as a key for the dictionary data.
     If the line does not being with "Section" then
         Add the line with the key section to the dictionary data. Note the dictionary should have a list of values for each key.
The function should then display the message "Done!".
Finally, the function should return the dictionary.
The second function should be named run and should have no parameters.
The function should call the first function with the file name "data/files/txt/books.txt" to retrieve the dictionary and store this in a local variable named data.
The function should then write out the data to the file "data/files/txt/generated.csv" in CSV format so that it looks similar to the following:

The Law Section,The Magna Carta
The Technology Section,How to build a robot
The Technology Section,How to build a flying car
The History Section,The history of everything

Create a new python file generate.py and store the file in the following location:
