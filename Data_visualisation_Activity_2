We wish to create a program to display the path Beep and Bop are taking through Robo City.

The program should consist of the following three functions:

The first function should be named small and should have no parameters.
The function should display a small square using a line plot.
The line should be a red dotted line with circle markers.
The second function should be named medium and should have no parameters. 
The function should display a medium square around the small square using a line plot.
The line should be a green dashed line with square markers.
The third function should be named large and should have no parameters.
The function should display a large square around the medium square using a line  plot.
The line should be a blue solid line with pentagon markers.

When executed, a line plot similar to the following should be displayed:
